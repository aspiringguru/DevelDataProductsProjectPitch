Ever wondered how mpg varies between cars?
Want an easy to use app that plots for you?

Users select the number of histogram bins
and the number of engine cylinders they want to see data for

Users can view the information they want.
Alternatively this app can be modified 
to provide other user input options and different chart outputs.
